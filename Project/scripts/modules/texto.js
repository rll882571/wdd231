            <b>Text 1: The Artist in Everyone: Preserving Childhood Creativity</b>
            <br><br>
            Pablo Picasso’s insightful observation, “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up”, points to a universal challenge: the loss of uninhibited creativity as we age. Children possess a spontaneous, fearless approach to creating that adults often lose due to self-doubt or external judgment. To combat this, one must intentionally integrate art into daily life. School projects promoting creation, such as developing an audio guide for a piece of art or constructing an assemblage from discarded materials, are important. These hands-on activities encourage continuous artistic practice and a unique, personal perspective on the world, ensuring the "inner artist" thrives beyond childhood.

The process involves defining clear goals—asking oneself where they want to be in five or ten years, considering their desired level of education, and potential careers.

            Life is a dynamic journey, often described as a series of events—some planned, others accidental—that make up a process of constant change. The coming-of-age film "Boyhood" masterfully illustrates this concept. Filmed over an extraordinary 12-year period with the same actors, it captures the genuine, unscripted physical and emotional development of a boy from age six to eighteen. This cinematic approach reinforces the real-life lesson that change is continuous and often messy. Learning to accept setbacks, adapt, and build resilience when plans don't work out is critical for thriving in the face of life's continuous unfolding.

            <br><br>
            Life is a dynamic journey, often described as a series of events—some planned, others accidental—that make up a process of constant change. The coming-of-age film "Boyhood" masterfully illustrates this concept. Filmed over an extraordinary 12-year period with the same actors, it captures the genuine, unscripted physical and emotional development of a boy from age six to eighteen. This cinematic approach reinforces the real-life lesson that change is continuous and often messy. Learning to accept setbacks, adapt, and build resilience when plans don't work out is critical for thriving in the face of life's continuous unfolding.

            Modern youth activism frequently utilizes social media as a powerful platform for advocacy.

This approach is an effective way to generate empathy and awareness, combating common societal misconceptions and reducing the "invisibility" of vulnerable populations.

            In underserved communities, young people are taking control of their own narratives to challenge deeply ingrained stereotypes. The initiative started by Rene Silva in the Complexo do Alemão favela, with his local newspaper, Voz da Comunidade, exemplifies this. Silva began with a hyper-local focus, reporting on daily life and basic infrastructural issues (like sanitation and electricity shortages) often overlooked by major news outlets. His use of social media, particularly during a significant police operation in 2010, amplified his voice, allowing his community to speak for itself. This act of self-representation helped foster new points of reference for young people and shifted external perceptions, demonstrating the immense power of youth-led media in driving community change.
