        <b>Text 1: What’s Wrong with Plagiarism?</b>
        <br><br>
        When you use someone else’s exact words or ideas in an assignment and present them as your own, you are plagiarizing.
        Plagiarism can be difficult to avoid, especially when you are writing an academic paper or working on a project. This happens because you need to use materials and information from different authors and sources, and it is easy to copy and paste their work.
        <br><br>
        “What’s the problem with that?”, you may think, since the information is correct. However, using content that is not yours without giving credit to the author is problematic for many reasons.

        Plagiarism is unethical. This happens because you are stealing another person’s hard work and the many hours they dedicated to research. You are also taking their original ideas and, more importantly, their exact words. This is, in fact, theft of intellectual property. Furthermore, you are gaining merit for something you did not create or think of. You could even win an award for work that is not your own. That would be unfair.

        In addition, plagiarism can result in severe consequences. Colleges and universities deal with plagiarism very strictly. For example, they may give you a very low grade, causing you to fail, or they may expel you entirely. As a student, you lose your good reputation and may lose your diploma and academic record. A reputation for dishonesty can follow you throughout your entire professional life.
        <br><br>
        Since plagiarism is a form of theft, you can also be taken to court for it. If found guilty, you may receive an expensive fine.

        To avoid plagiarism, it is important to record and cite all the sources of information used in your work. If you are using someone’s exact words or original ideas, put them in quotation marks and add an in-text citation, such as (Mills, 2014); or add a footnote. If you are reproducing graphs, images, illustrations, and so on, make sure to cite the sources. Remember to credit all the sources you cited or used for research in your bibliography.

        Another thing you should do is paraphrase. This happens when you take a sentence or paragraph and rewrite the ideas in your own words. A good tip is to use synonyms and change the grammatical structures from passive to active voice or vice versa. You can do this when you need to keep the details of the original content. However, you must still use a citation. When you only want to use the main points of a text, the best idea is to summarize. A summary is shorter than the original text. It is a good idea to use simpler words and expressions. This shows that you understood the topic and can explain it with your own words.

        Finally, it is important to allocate enough time for research and writing. Doing work in a rush may increase the risk of unintentional plagiarism. If you take your time, you will produce better work, understand the topic more deeply, and avoid the risk of losing your academic achievements.
