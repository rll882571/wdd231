             A film's soundtrack is arguably as important as its visuals. The music chosen—whether an original score or a compilation of existing songs—is carefully directed to evoke specific emotions and enhance the narrative. When a soundtrack becomes popular, it often drives huge public interest in the film and, sometimes, even boosts the careers of the featured performers. Listening to a soundtrack is often a way for fans to re-experience the "just for fun" feeling of their favorite movie or series.
