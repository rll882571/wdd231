            <b>Text 1: A MORE AGED POPULATION THAN EVER BEFORE</b>
            <br><br>
            We wont just be wrestling with the fact that the world’s population is exploding – but people are living longer than ever, too. Which is great – but all those senior citizens are going to require care. In fact, the number of centenarians will increase more than 50 times – from 500,000 today to over 26 million by 2100. From the UK to Japan to China, societies with large numbers of people over 65 will become more common. In the next couple of decades, as that increase starts to happen, we’ll need better care for the elderly (Japan is even eyeing robots) and perhaps policies to allow more immigrants to try and make up for ageing workforces and in some cases, declining birth rates.
            <br><br>
            <b>Question:</b> According to the text, what is one potential policy solution mentioned to address the issue of aging workforces?
