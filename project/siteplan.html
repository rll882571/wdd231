    <h3>Desktop View Layout:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The **Header** includes the FCC Logo and the main navigation links (Home, Discover, Directory, Join) visible and horizontal.</li>
        <li>A large, responsive **Hero Image** dominates the top, featuring a CTA button (Keynote Tickets).</li>
        <li>The main content area is a **multi-column layout** where the Events Spotlight, Current Weather, and 3-Day Forecast appear in distinct blocks, often side-by-side.</li>
        <li>Three **Business Spotlights** are displayed in a row at the bottom of the main content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mobile View Layout:</h3>

        <li>The **Header** utilizes a "Hamburger" icon to collapse the main navigation links, prioritizing screen space.</li>
        <li>The **Hero Image** remains at the top, scaling down for width.</li>
        <li>All content blocks (Events, Weather, Forecast) are **stacked vertically** in a single-column layout to ensure easy scrolling and readability on narrow screens[cite: 45].</li>

    </ul>
